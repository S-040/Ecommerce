## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used:

-SQL: Employed for efficient data extraction, filtering, and transformation. Complex queries were designed to retrieve meaningful insights from large datasets./n
-Python: Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and advanced analytics. Libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib played a crucial role in handling and visualizing data./n
-Jupyter Notebook: Served as the interactive environment for writing and running code, visualizing data, and documenting the analysis process. The flexibility and rich features of Jupyter Notebook significantly enhanced the workflow./n
-Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for creating detailed and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, enabling clear communication of insights through graphs and charts./n
-Scikit-Learn: Leveraged for building predictive models, helping in forecasting sales and understanding customer segmentation.

## Libraries:
-[pandas]
-[sqlalchemy]
-[sqlite3 (if using SQLite)]
-[psycopg2 (if using PostgreSQL)]
-[mysql-connector-python (if using MySQL)]
